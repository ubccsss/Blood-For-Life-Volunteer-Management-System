# Blood-For-Life-Volunteer-Management-System

### What will you be building, and how will it be used?

We aim to build a volunteer management system that makes the shift assignment and logging process effortless. Volunteers will be able to log in, view all available shifts within a certain date range, and sign up for the ones that fit their schedules. The system will also track the history of each volunteer's shifts and ensure compliance with federal regulations (FIPPA). We're looking to include features that limit the number of volunteers per shift and distinguish between on-call and confirmed statuses, all while offering a user experience akin to a simplified registration process.

### Why is it important?

This project is about more than just developing a system - it's about supporting a cause that saves lives - blood and stem cell donations. By streamlining the process of managing volunteers, we enable the UBC Blood for Life club to focus more on their mission and less on administrative work. This system will be a game-changer, enhancing efficiency and enabling the club to have real-time access to vital metrics like total volunteer hours and attendance rates.

### Who are we looking for?:

#### For Developers:

You don't need to have all these skills yet - this project offers a great learning experience:

- **Web Development:** Knowledge of front-end and back-end technologies will be beneficial.
- **Database Management:** Any experience with database creation and management would be an advantage.
- **Resonating with the club mission:** Understanding why UBC Blood For Life does what they do will be a huge plus.

#### For Tech Leads:

As a Tech Lead, we need you to have solid expertise in the above areas and:

- **Team Leadership:** The ability to guide and coordinate a team of developers is a must.
- **User Experience Design:** Skill in creating a user-friendly system for both volunteers and admins.
- **Privacy Regulations:** This project must be compliant with provincial privacy regulations (FIPPA), so understanding about these policies or experience with similar high-security tasks is an asset.
- **User Authentication:** Understanding/experience of how to build a system with hundreds of potential users, and different tiers of privileges.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** Understanding how to build scalable solutions and plan for future maintenance is important, especially considering the site needs to be easily managed by non-coders in the future.
